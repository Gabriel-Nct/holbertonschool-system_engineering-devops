## 🏆 Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack 🚀
**Single Server Infrastructure**
- 🏠 Design a one-server infrastructure for `www.foobar.com`
- 📦 Components: LAMP stack (Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP/Python)
- 🎯 Focus: Understanding basic web infrastructure

**Key Learning Points:**
- Server roles and responsibilities
- Domain name configuration
- DNS record types
- Communication protocols

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure 🔗
**Three-Server Setup**
- ⚖️ Add load balancer (HAproxy)
- 🖥️ Distribute load across multiple servers
- 🗃️ Implement database replication

**Key Learning Points:**
- Load balancing algorithms
- Active-Active vs Active-Passive setups
- Primary-Replica database clusters
- Eliminating single points of failure

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Infrastructure 🛡️
**Security & Monitoring Implementation**
- 🔥 Add firewalls for security
- 🔒 Implement HTTPS with SSL certificates
- 📊 Set up monitoring systems

**Key Learning Points:**
- Firewall configuration and benefits
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Monitoring strategies and data collection
- QPS (Queries Per Second) monitoring

### Task 3: Scale Up 📈
**Advanced Scaling**
- 🏗️ Separate components onto dedicated servers
- ⚖️ Implement load balancer clustering
- 🔧 Optimize for high traffic scenarios

**Key Learning Points:**
- Component separation benefits
- Load balancer clustering
- Scalability best practices

## 📊 Infrastructure Evolution
