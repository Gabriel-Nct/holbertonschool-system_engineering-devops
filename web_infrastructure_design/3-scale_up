Scale Up Infrastructure Documentation
Overview
This documentation describes the scaled-up infrastructure that separates web servers, application servers, and database components across multiple servers, with HAProxy load balancing for high availability and improved performance.
Architecture Components

1. Load Balancer (HAProxy Cluster)

Purpose: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers
Configuration: Cluster setup with redundancy
Servers:

Load Balancer 1 (Primary)
Load Balancer 2 (Secondary/Backup)

2. Web Servers

Purpose: Serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
Technology: Nginx
Count: 2 servers for redundancy
Function: Handle static file requests and proxy dynamic requests to application servers

3. Application Servers

Purpose: Process business logic and dynamic content
Technology: Gunicorn/uWSGI with Python/Django or similar
Count: 2+ servers for load distribution
Function: Handle API requests, session management, and application logic

4. Database Server

Purpose: Store and manage application data
Technology: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Configuration: Primary database with optional read replicas
Function: Data persistence and retrieval
